Smart Contracts and Blockchain Work

This folder contains work that I have done through tutorials, playing around with Solidity, and my own pet projects, that are all designed to live on a Blockchain.  I have a particular interest in Ethereum and Cardano, and see things like Smart Contracts and DAPPS revolutionizing the way that people and computers interact.
